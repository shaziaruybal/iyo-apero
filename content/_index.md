description: I am originally from Ecuador and USA living in Melbourne, Australia since 2014. As a molecular epidemiologist with expertise in population genetics, epidemiology, and bioinformatics, I'm interested in combining these approaches to population-based studies of infectious diseases, particularly malaria and more recently COVID-19. I am also an avid R user and am passionate about open science and the development of digital tools for research.
