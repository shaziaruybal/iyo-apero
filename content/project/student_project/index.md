title: Understanding malaria infection dynamics

### Project details
Malaria is an infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. Renewed intensification of global malaria control interventions over the past decade has had significant success. However, as we try to eliminate malaria, infections become harder to detect yet contribute to ongoing transmission. We aim to better understand infection burden in areas approaching elimination. 

Using samples collected from large-scale epidemiological field studies in Asia-Pacific, this project will apply novel genotyping and molecular diagnostic techniques to identify and track malaria infections over space and time and within individuals. Genetic data will be related to epidemiological data helping us understand spatiotemporal infection dynamics and risk factors.

This project will develop your skills in genetic and next-generation sequencing techniques, epidemiology, computational data analysis, and will involve work with international collaborators.
