## Abstract 

Immunity to *Plasmodium falciparum* is non-sterilising, thus individuals residing in malaria-endemic areas are at risk of infection throughout their lifetime. Here we seek to find a genomic epidemiological explanation for why residents of all ages harbour blood stage infections despite lifelong exposure to *P. falciparum* in areas of high transmission. We do this by exploring, for the first known time, the age-specific patterns of diversity of variant antigen encoding (*var*) genes in the reservoir of infection. Microscopic and submicroscopic *P. falciparum* infections were analysed at the end of the wet and dry seasons in 2012–2013 for a cohort of 1541 residents aged from 1 to 91 years in an area characterised by high seasonal malaria transmission in Ghana. By sequencing the near ubiquitous Duffy-binding-like alpha domain (DBLα) that encodes immunogenic domains, we defined *var* gene diversity in an estimated 1096 genomes detected in sequential wet and dry season sampling of this cohort. Unprecedented *var* (DBLα) diversity was observed in all ages with 42,399 unique *var* types detected. There was a high degree of maintenance of types between seasons (>40% seen more than once), with many of the same types, especially upsA, appearing multiple times in isolates from different individuals. Children and adolescents were found to be significant reservoirs of *var* DBLα diversity compared with adults. *Var* repertoires within individuals were highly variable, with children having more related *var* repertoires compared to adolescents and adults. Individuals of all ages harboured multiple genomes with *var* repertoires unrelated to those infecting other hosts. High turnover of parasites with diverse isolate *var* repertoires was also observed in all ages. These age-specific patterns are best explained by variant-specific immune selection. The observed level of *var* diversity for the population was then used to simulate the development of variant-specific immunity to the diverse *var* types under conservative assumptions. Simulations showed that the extent of observed *var* diversity with limited repertoire relatedness was sufficient to explain why adolescents and adults in this community remain susceptible to blood stage infection, even with multiple genomes.
