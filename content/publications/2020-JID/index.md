## Abstract 

### Background.
The majority of *Plasmodium falciparum* infections, constituting the reservoir in all ages, are asymptomatic in high- transmission settings in Africa. The role of this reservoir in the evolution and spread of drug resistance was explored.

### Methods. 
Population genetic analyses of the key drug resistance–mediating polymorphisms were analyzed in a cross-sectional survey of asymptomatic *P. falciparum* infections across all ages in Bongo District, Ghana.

### Results. 
Seven years after the policy change to artemisinin-based combination therapies in 2005, the pfcrt K76 and pfmdr1 N86 wild-type alleles have nearly reached fixation and have expanded via soft selective sweeps on multiple genetic backgrounds. By constructing the pfcrt-pfmdr1-pfdhfr-pfdhps multilocus haplotypes, we found that the alleles at these loci were in linkage equilibrium and that multidrug-resistant parasites have not expanded in this reservoir. For pfk13, 32 nonsynonymous mutations were identified; however, none were associated with artemisinin-based combination therapy resistance.

### Conclusions. 
The prevalence and selection of alleles/haplotypes by antimalarials were similar to that observed among clinical cases in Ghana, indicating that they do not represent 2 subpopulations with respect to these markers. Thus, the *P. falciparum* reservoir in all ages can contribute to the maintenance and spread of antimalarial resistance.
